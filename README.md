# Vite + React + Invrz Template

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Vite + React + Invrz** project template! ðŸŽ‰ This template is designed to help you quickly get started with a new React application using Vite as the build tool and Invrz Patterns for UI components and design.

This project includes a basic setup with React Router for routing and a few example components to demonstrate how to structure your app and add new pages.

## Project Overview

In this template, you will find an example of how to use `react-router-dom` for routing and how to integrate Invrz Patterns into your React application.

### Key Features

- **React Router v7** for client-side routing
- **Invrz Patterns UI** for modern and responsive design components
- Example components including a counter, contact form, and quote generator

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-react-invrz-template.git
   cd vite-react-invrz-template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   Start the Vite development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

```
/src
  /assets
    react.svg
    vite.svg
  /routes
    /_home
      page.tsx
    /contact
      page.tsx
    /counter
      page.tsx
    /quotes
      page.tsx
    /todo
      page.tsx
  App.tsx
  App.css
  index.css
  main.tsx
  other react files
```

### Components

- **`Home`**: Welcome page and introduction to the template
- **`Counter`**: Simple counter example component
- **`ContactForm`**: Contact form with a basic `handleSubmit` function
- **`QuoteGenerator`**: Component that displays quotes based on the URL parameter
- **`TodoList`**: Basic todo list example

### Routes

The `App.tsx` file configures the routes for the application:

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Counter from './routes/counter/page';
import ContactForm from './routes/contact/page';
import QuoteGenerator from './routes/quotes/page';
import TodoList from './routes/todo/page';
import Home from './routes/_home/page';

import "./App.css";
import "patterns-ui/styles/main.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/counter" element={<Counter />} />
        <Route path="/todos" element={<TodoList />} />
        <Route path="/contact" element={<ContactForm />} />
        <Route path="/quote/:index" element={<QuoteGenerator />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- **`/`**: Renders the `Home` component
- **`/counter`**: Renders the `Counter` component
- **`/todos`**: Renders the `TodoList` component
- **`/contact`**: Renders the `ContactForm` component
- **`/quote/:index`**: Renders the `QuoteGenerator` component with a dynamic `:index` parameter

### Adding a New Route

To add a new route, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Component**

   Add a new component in the `routes` directory.

2. **Import the Component**

   Import the new component into `App.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   import NewPage from './routes/newpage/page';
   ```

3. **A. Add the Route**

   Add a new `<Route />` element in the `Routes` block of `App.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   <Route path="/newpage" element={<NewPage />} />
   ```

   For example, to add an "About" page:

   ```tsx
   import About from './routes/about/page';
   // Add this line in the <Routes> block
   <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
   ```
   ```

4. **B. Or Modify a Route**

   Replace any `<Route />` element in the `Routes` block of `App.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   <Route path="/newpage" element={<NewPage />} />
   ```

   For example, to replace the "Counter" with "About" page:

   ```tsx
   - import Counter from './routes/counter/page';
   + import About from './routes/about/page';
     // Change this line in the <Routes> block
   - <Route path="/counter" element={<Counter />} />
   + <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
   ```
   If you haven't worked with diff before, in the above example, "-" represents lines of code which existed earlier, whilst "+" represent the code which replaces earlier code.
